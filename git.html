git commands:-

-> git init
        (Initialized empty Git repository)
-> git add filename
        (to track the file)
-> git commit -m "file1 commited"
         (file1 commited)
-> git branch -M main 
        (to change the branch from master to main)
-> ssh-keygen -o 
        (Generating public/private rsa key pair)
-> cat url(path url)
        (cat doesn't play a role in SSH key generation or its functionality. 
         It's just a tool to view the content (your public key) stored in the id_rsa.pub file)

-> git remote add origin url
-> git push -u origin main
        (git push: command used for pushing local commits to a remote repository.
               -u: This flag tells git to set an "upstream" branch for the current branch.
           origin: This is the shorthand name for the remote repository you're pushing to. It's typically set up when you clone the repository for the first time.
             main: This is the name of the local branch you're pushing to the remote repository.)
